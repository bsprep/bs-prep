## What is BSPrep?

BSPrep is a learning platform built for students doing the IITM BS Degree. It is focused on the Qualifier level, which is the first real exam students have to clear before continuing in the program.

Everything on the platform is built around that one goal. The courses cover all 4 Qualifier subjects in Tamil. Mentors who have already cleared the Qualifier take live weekly sessions. There is an in-browser compiler, past quiz practice, GPA tools, and a community space for doubts.

This is not an official IIT Madras product. It is built and maintained by students.

## What we are trying to do

Most students who join the IITM BS program have no idea what the Qualifier actually demands. The syllabus is there, but there is no structured way to prepare for it, especially in Tamil. BSPrep exists to fix that.

The goal is to make sure no student fails the Qualifier just because they did not know how to prepare. Not because of language, not because they could not afford coaching, and not because they were doing it alone.
